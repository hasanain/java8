# Java8 demos for 335
## Usage
This is an eclipse project that [@hjamal](https://github.com/hjamal/) used to lecture on some features of Java 8. There are two packages in this project, notDone and done, not done has code in pre java 8 and done has Java 8 code.

When this code was used in lecture by [@hjamal](https://github.com/hjamal/) code from both packages was displayed side by side to show the differences.

## Topics in Java 8
While there isn't a specific presentation that is attached with this demo, the presenter can cover the following topics by analyzing code with students. Below is a breakdown of topics and the files associated with them. The list will be numbered in the order that [@hjamal](https://github.com/hjamal/) went through them.

1. Functions: Function type, Functional Interfaces, using forEach as an example of default methods in interfaces
2. Lambda1: Lambda Expressions
3. Lambda2: Streams, Optionals, Method references
4. Euler1: IntStreamBuilder, Streams
5. Euler2: Using a list as a stream and Optionals
6. Euler2Iter: Using iterators as generators without a yield statement. Java doesn't have a yield statement but other lanaguges do.

The point of this presentation was to introduce these features to students that haven't seen functional programming so there isn't much theory.
